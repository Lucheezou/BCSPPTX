# CRITICAL FIX: Agenda Sub-Bullet Indentation

## The Problem
**Agenda items with sub-bullets were NOT being indented in PPT, even though HTML was correct.**

All items appeared on the same line like this:
```
✓ Main Topic
✓ Sub-topic     ← Should be indented but wasn't
✓ Another Topic
```

## Root Cause Found!

### The Issue
The `cleanTextContent()` function was using `.trim()` which **REMOVED leading spaces** from agenda items!

**What was happening:**
1. AI correctly extracts: `["Main Topic", "  Sub-topic", "Another Topic"]` ✅
2. Cleaning function calls: `cleanTextContent("  Sub-topic")`
3. `.trim()` removes spaces: `"Sub-topic"` ❌
4. PPT receives: `["Main Topic", "Sub-topic", "Another Topic"]`
5. No indentation detected = all items render at same level

### The Culprit Code
```javascript
// Line 475 in cleanTextContent()
.trim();  // ← THIS was removing the leading spaces!
```

**Used by:**
```javascript
// Line 633 (original)
cleanSlide.items = cleanSlide.items.map(item => cleanTextContent(item));
// ↑ This was stripping the "  " prefix from sub-items!
```

## The Fix

### Code Changes

**File:** [server.js](test/server.js):631-641

**Before:**
```javascript
if (cleanSlide.items) {
  cleanSlide.items = cleanSlide.items.map(item => cleanTextContent(item));
  // ↑ Removes leading spaces!
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (cleanSlide.items) {
  cleanSlide.items = cleanSlide.items.map(item => {
    if (!item) return '';
    // Preserve leading spaces for indentation
    const leadingSpaces = item.match(/^(\s*)/)[0];
    const cleanedText = cleanTextContent(item);
    // Re-add leading spaces after cleaning
    return leadingSpaces + cleanedText;
  });
}
```

### How It Works Now
1. **Extract leading spaces:** `const leadingSpaces = item.match(/^(\s*)/)[0]`
   - `"  Sub-topic"` → captures `"  "`
2. **Clean the text:** `cleanTextContent(item)`
   - Fixes encoding, removes entities, trims (removes spaces)
3. **Re-add spaces:** `leadingSpaces + cleanedText`
   - `"  " + "Sub-topic"` → `"  Sub-topic"` ✅
4. **PPT detects spaces:** `item.startsWith('  ')` → indent!

```
AGENDA FORMATTING (CRITICAL - MANDATORY):
- MUST preserve hierarchical structure with TWO-SPACE indentation
- Main items: NO spaces at start
- Sub-items: EXACTLY TWO SPACES at start
- DO NOT trim() or strip() leading spaces from sub-items
- The two-space prefix "  " is REQUIRED for proper PPT indentation
- NEVER remove leading spaces from agenda items
```

## Testing the Fix

### Verify It Works
1. Upload document with nested agenda items
2. Generate PPT
3. Open agenda slide
4. **Check:** Sub-items should be indented to the right
5. **Check:** Sub-items have smaller text (16pt vs 18pt)
6. **Check:** Sub-items have smaller checkmarks (20pt vs 24pt)

### Expected Result
```
Before (Broken):          After (Fixed):
✓ Main Topic             ✓ Main Topic
✓ Sub-topic        →       ✓ Sub-topic  ← Now indented!
✓ Another Topic          ✓ Another Topic
```

## Why This Was Hard to Find

1. **HTML was correct** - Made it seem like a rendering issue
2. **AI extraction worked** - JSON had the spaces initially
3. **Hidden in cleaning step** - The `.trim()` buried in cleanup
4. **Subtle bug** - Only affected agenda items with leading spaces

---

## Key Takeaway

**NEVER use `.trim()` on text that needs to preserve formatting like:**
- Indented lists
- Code blocks
- Formatted text with significant whitespace

**Instead:**
- Extract leading/trailing whitespace first
- Clean the content
- Re-apply the whitespace
