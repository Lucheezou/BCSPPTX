## ðŸ”§ Issue Resolution: HTML to PPT Conversion

### Problem Identified
Initial implementation showed improvements in HTML preview but not in generated PPT files.

### Root Cause
The AI extraction layer (which converts HTML to JSON for PPT generation) was not properly configured to:
1. Preserve bullet formatting from HTML
2. Recognize "Go Deeper" slide types
3. Exclude statistics slides completely

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. **Removed Statistics Template from Extraction**
- Deleted statistics slide type from JSON extraction examples
- AI will no longer attempt to create statistics slides

#### 2. **Enhanced AI Extraction Instructions**
Added explicit "CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES" section with:
- **BULLET FORMATTING (MANDATORY):**
  - Always preserve bullets (â€¢) and sub-bullets (â—¦)
  - Convert paragraphs to bullets if needed
  - Never return plain text paragraphs

- **SLIDE TYPE DETECTION:**
  - "Go Deeper" in title â†’ `go_deeper` type
  - "Employer Implications" â†’ teal textbox
  - Explicit exclusion of statistics slides

#### 3. **Updated Fallback Regex Parser**
Enhanced the regex-based HTML parser to:
- Extract `<li>` elements as bullets
- Convert paragraphs to bulleted format
- Detect "Go Deeper" keywords and assign correct type
- Preserve bullet characters in content

### Verification Steps
To confirm PPT improvements are working:

1. **Check for Bullets:**
   - Open generated PPT
   - Content slides should show bullet points (â€¢)
   - Sub-points should be indented (â—¦)

2. **Verify "Go Deeper" Slides:**
   - Look for slides with "Go Deeper" in title
   - Should have gray section header
   - Content should be bulleted

3. **Confirm No Statistics Slides:**
   - Generated deck should not contain graph/stats layouts
   - Unless explicitly requested in source document

4. **Check Table Auto-Sizing:**
   - Tables should fit content without overflow
   - Column widths proportional to content

5. **Validate 3-Slide Structure:**
   - Each article should have:
     - Background + Applicable Employers
     - Go Deeper (if present in source)
     - Employer Implications (teal sidebar)
